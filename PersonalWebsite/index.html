                    <p> <i>I am a <strong>student</strong> at <a href="https://www.ncuindia.edu/">the NorthCap University</a> and I am in my
                            final year.üòø</i></p>
                    <p> Hi, I'm Shadab Alam, a software developer and competitive programmer based in Gurugram, India.
                    
                    I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from The NorthCap University, where I honed my skills in data structures,
                    algorithms, DBMS, OOPS, and software engineering. I'm passionate about creating innovative solutions to complex
                    problems, and I believe in constantly learning and improving my skills.
                    
                    During my summer internships at Pie Info Systems and Huawei, I developed a professional GST accounting software using
                    Flutter SDK, which increased chartered accountant productivity by 80%. I also designed the app's onboarding pages and
                    five screens while working in a team of four. At Huawei, I developed an android chatting application with Google Maps
                    APIs integration, which was released on Huawei App Gallery, providing access to millions of potential users.
                    
                    I'm proficient in Java, C++, Python, and frameworks like Django. I have experience working with databases like MySQL and
                    MongoDB and tools like Git. I'm also familiar with AWS and Azure.
                    
                    In my spare time, I enjoy solving coding problems on platforms like Leetcode, Codeforces, and CodeChef. I have solved
                    over 300 questions on these platforms and have achieved a 50% fee waiver and a 5 lakhs scholarship in college. I scored
                    93.0% in 12th Board Exams and 10 CGPA in 10th Board Exams.
                    
                    I'm a motivator, leader, creative thinker, and excellent communicator with a passion for writing clean code. I'm also
                    adept at unit testing and debugging and thrive in fast-paced, agile environments with tight deadlines.
